# FarmEasy

## A platform to help farmers by predicting and suggesting crops using Machine Learning.

A platform that helps farmers by predicting rainfall using an LSTM network for time-series prediction and suggesting
crops based on factors like region, soil, and the amount of predicted rainfall. The platform was built using Python-Django and ReactJs
and had functionalities like a chatbot and a Web RTC- based video calling system.
